# ICSify-Ulink-Timetable

A Tampermonkey script to add an ics file download button to the Ulink-iSAMS timetable page.

## Why I made this

I am tired of checking the school timetable from iSAMS or the iStudent app, so I created this script to bring all the lessons into my computer calendar.

## How to use

**A (modern) browser, with Tampermonkey extension installed, is required.**

- 1. Import the script.
- 2. A button "Export to ICS" will appear on the [timetable page](https://pupils.ulinkedu.com/api/profile/timetable/).

## Credits

- [ics.js](https://github.com/nwcell/ics.js)

    A browser friendly .ics/.vcs file generator written entirely in JavaScript!

## Note

I may not update this script as it already works with the latest (2024.08.20) page and Ulink rarely updates its student portal page.

# ICSify-Ulink-Timetable

A Tampermonkey script to add a ics file download button on Ulink-iSAMS timetable page.

# Why I made this

I am tired of checking the school timetable from the iSAMS or the iStudent App, so I created this script to brings all of the lessons into my computer calendar.

# How to use

**A (modern) browser, with Tampermonkey extension installed, is required.**

- 1. Import the script.
- 2. A button "Export to ICS" will appear on the [timetable page](https://pupils.ulinkedu.com/api/profile/timetable/).

# Credits

- [ics.js](https://github.com/nwcell/ics.js)

    A browser friendly .ics/.vcs file generator written entirely in JavaScript!

# Note

I may not update this script any more, since it is already working with the latest (2024.08.20) page.
